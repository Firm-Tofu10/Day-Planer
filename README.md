# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
Bryson Benson
To do:
Save Events for each hour of the day.
The starter code uses the Moment.js- https://momentjs.com/ library to work with date and time, but feel free to use a different JavaScript solution to handle this functionality since Moment.js
 since Moment.js is considered a "legacy" more about some alternative solutions- https://momentjs.com/docs/#/-project-status/
