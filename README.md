This project was created using some provided starter code in the CSS and HTML however most od this was for style or linking Jquery,Bootstrap, and movment.js. (All the Javascript code was added to this project that was not an API call.)

I injoyed the feedback loop of this assinment alot, it was realy cool to see this project interact in real time with the movment.js API.

This project lets you plan your work day by letting you save your plan line by line with a time attached. It will then change the color of the line based on the time of day to let the user see iif they are meeting there own plan.
